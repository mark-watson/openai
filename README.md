# Common Lisp library to access OpenAI GPT3 APIs

From my book URI: https://leanpub.com/lovinglisp

There is a **Makefile** in the repo https://github.com/mark-watson/loving-common-lisp that can be copied
to your **~/quicklisp/local-projects** directory. Then in **~/quicklisp/local-projects** run:

    make fetch

to get all of the librsary examples from my book.


## setting your OpenAI API key
 
 Define the  "OPENAI_KEY" environment variable with the value of your OpenAI API key
 
## Example:

```lisp
cl-user> (ql:quickload :openai)
cl-user> (openai:completions "The President went to Congress" 200)
" instead. The Congress was not oblivious of what the Supreme Court's
majority had ruled. Even four Justices had found nothing to criticize
in the President's requirement that the Federal Government's four-year
contract with Microsoft be extended by twice as much, that the burden
of proof be put on Microsoft to show, not a violation, but that it
should be allowed to compete in any open industry, that the
combination of a powerful operating system with a powerful PC
operating system also give to Microsoft a PC-compatible
interface-vendor neutral, the Court called it- which other operating
systems could match, based on progress and development of time. Why
should that not be the case? Should the Court declare that any
operating system which antedated Microsoft's dominant operating system
would not be free to enter the market? The Justices on the Court, the
Chief Justice included, found it an extraordinarily tough question.\"
In a minority decision, Chief Justice Rehnquist, for instance, writes
this: \"Justice Kennedy's"
```

Also try **openai:summarize** and **openai:answer-question**. See my book for examples and example output.
